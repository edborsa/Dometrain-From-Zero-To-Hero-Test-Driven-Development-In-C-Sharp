## Stories
### 01
As a car parking administrator 
I want to apply a pricing table by the hour to offer to customers

- The pricing table should cover the 24-hours
- The price is calculated per hour
- Ordered by hour limit


### 02
As a car parking administrator
I want to define a maximum daily price 
So that I can define a competitive daily price for those leaving the car for a longer period

- The maximum price can't exceed the price of 24 hours through the plan
- Will be equal to the sum if not defined


### 03
As a driver
I want the pricing service to calculate the total parking cost accurately based on the entry and exit times, factoring in any partial hours or maximum daily price
